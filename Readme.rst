Jabref journal name abbreviations for astronomy
=====================================================

Many journals require you to submit references with abbreviated journal names, the style of which may vary from journal to journal.

Fortunately, Jabref_ provides an easy means of toggling your Bibtex catalogue journal entries between full and abbreviated form 
(`Tools -> Abbreviate journal names`). 

It's also possible to use your own custom list of journal abbreviations 
(`Options -> Manage journal abbreviations`). Since I couldn't find any ready made lists of abbreviations for astronomers, I created this repository. Currently I've only provided an incomplete list of abbreviations in the MNRAS style, but this will grow over time, hopefully with the help of fellow astronomers.

I recommend that you maintain a \`long-form' bib file containing all your references with full-length journal names, and only make a copy for conversion to abbreviated form when you are actually submitting a paper. That way you prevent any risk of corrupting your reference catalogue through mishaps.

MNRAS abbreviation style:
-----------------------------
MNRAS require that journal names be in \`initials only' form for `frequently cited journals <http://www.wiley.com/bw/submit.asp?ref=0035-8711>`_,
otherwise use the `IAU standard abbreviations <http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/abbreviations/>`_.
